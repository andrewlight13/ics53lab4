client2.c execution syntax
this needs to be rewritten entirely, but it works fine for basic testing
./progname webaddr connport proxyport

webaddr- web address to connect to, e.g. www.ics.uci.edu (no http://, no suffix)

connport - port to connect to web address on, pretty much always 80

proxyport - port for proxy to listen for connections on (i just use something between 5000-6000, though we'll have to safe it so they can't use reserved ports)

most of this needs to be read from the HTTP header in the final submission obviously, except for proxyport, which we'll still pass through args
